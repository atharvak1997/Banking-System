## üìç Overview

1. You will gain a thorough understanding of database design, including generating reliable and consistent code for interacting with the database using transactions. You will also learn about database isolation levels and how to correctly utilize them in a production environment. In addition to databases, you will learn how to utilize Docker for local development, effectively use Git for code management, and leverage GitHub Actions for automated unit testing.

2. You will acquire the skills to construct a collection of RESTful HTTP APIs using Gin, a widely adopted Golang framework for creating web services. This encompasses various aspects such as configuring the application, implementing robust unit testing with a simulated database, managing errors, verifying user identities, and ensuring API security through JWT and PASETO access tokens.

3. You will gain knowledge on building your application using Docker and deploying it to a production Kubernetes cluster on AWS. The lectures provide comprehensive instructions with a detailed, step-by-step guide. You will learn essential topics such as building a minimal Docker image, setting up an AWS account, creating a production database, securely managing production secrets, establishing a Kubernetes cluster using EKS, automating image building and deployment to the EKS cluster using GitHub Actions, acquiring a domain name and routing traffic to your service, ensuring secure connections with HTTPS, and automatically renewing TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

4. We will explore various advanced backend topics. These include the management of user sessions, the creation of gRPC APIs, the utilization of gRPC gateway to handle both gRPC and HTTP requests simultaneously, the integration of Swagger documentation into the backend service, the ability to update records partially by leveraging optional parameters, and the development of structured logger HTTP middlewares and gRPC interceptors.

5. Asynchronous processing in Golang by implementing background workers and utilizing Redis as a message queue. Additionally, we will discuss the importance of gracefully shutting down the server to safeguard processing resources. It's worth noting that this section is continually being updated, and we will regularly upload new videos covering additional topics such as sending emails, gracefully shutting down servers, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), bulk inserts, and more. Therefore, I encourage you to revisit this platform periodically to explore and access the latest content.
